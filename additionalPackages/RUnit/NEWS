Changes in RUnit 0.4.26
    o   isValidTestSuite: fixed insufficient if expression handling, reported by Rich Calaway; 
        extended validity checks

Changes in RUnit 0.4.25
    o   enable redirection of error and log messages to file, controlled via new 
        global option 'outfile', (following a suggestion by Seth Falcon)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.24
    o   added RUnit specific options 'verbose' and 'silent' to global options list 
        to allow control of test log output
    o   moved unit tests from tests/ to inst/unitTests 
    o   added Makefile for executing unit tests (using R wiki example)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.23
    o   vignette: fixed function name in example code, reported by  Blair Christian
    o   init .testLogger to avoid R CMD check NOTE messages
    o   allow verbosity of console output log to be controlled: added 'verbose' argument
        to runTestFile and runTestSuite (following a suggestion by Seth Falcon)
    o   test logger object declared as S3 class 'TestLogger'

Changes in RUnit 0.4.22
    o   clarified applicable license: GPL 2
    o   defineTestSuite: gained some argument checks
    o   isValidTestSuite: check for empty name
    o   includeTracker: fix `<- if` handling

Changes in RUnit 0.4.21
    o   documentation issues corrected, identified by new R 2.9.0 devel Rd parser

Changes in RUnit 0.4.20
    o   test protocol generation on Mac OS X failed due to incorrect code to identify
        'gcc' version  
    o   Rd documentation updated

Changes in RUnit 0.4.19
    o   test protocol now states check number per test case
    o   changed check for object class to is() to allow derived class objects to pass 
        (suggested by Philippe Grosjean)
    o   removed start up message

Changes in RUnit 0.4.18
    o   seq_along introduced instead of seq( ) for efficiency and R version dependency set to 
        2.4.0 when seq_along was introduced
    o   some small changes to avoid warnings with options(warnPartialMatchArgs=TRUE)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.17
    o   corrected documentation example code
 
Changes in RUnit 0.4.16
    o   changed the environment test code files are evaluated, now 
        a new environment outside the RUnit namespace is utilized,
        allowing e.g. setClass calls without specifying where=.GlobalEnv
    o   updated documentation to use encoding latin1
    o   use LazyLoad: yes instead of SaveImage:yes (to be deprecated for R 2.6.0)
    o   internal error handler rewritten to be more failure robust
    o   added new test cases for .setUp and .tearDown, extended tests
        to cover S4 class and method behaviour in check* functions
    o   example on S4 virtual class testing added
    o   utility function to compare to RUnitTestResult objects added:
        concept idea for comparing and optimizing test suite
        performance (share/R/checkCode.r)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.15
    o   compatibility to R 1.9.0 as declared in DESCRIPTION: removed calls to isTRUE 
        as this was introduced only in R 2.1.0, replaced where needed by identical(TRUE, x)
    o   fixed printHTMLProtocol: on Windows Makeconf does not exist so
        CC compiler used by R cannot be queried this way (reported by
        Tobias Verbeke)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.14
    o   stated all package dependencies in DESCRIPTION, required for R
        2.4.0 compatibility
    
Changes in RUnit 0.4.13
    o   allow the RNG to be set by the user via new arguments 'rngKind' and 
        'rngNormalKind' to functions defineTestSuite and runTestFile (patch by Seth Falcon)
    o   fixed exit status: RNG kind was left changed after runTestSuite execution in 
        user workspace
    o   email contact address modified

Changes in RUnit 0.4.12
    o   allow *.R test case file extension (suggested by Gregor Gorjanc)
    o   fixed code typo in example vignette (spotted by Gregor Gorjanc)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.11
    o   checkException: argument silent added to allow to suppress
        error messages emitted by the failing function
    o   inspect: added argument track, which _has_ to be provided
        at each invocation to avoid recursive default argument
        reference call errors (experimental: subject to change if this
        leads to new incompatibilities)

Changes in RUnit 0.4.9
    o   checkEquals has new compatibility argument checkNames

Changes in RUnit 0.4.8
    o   checkIdentical added, to allow to check for exact identity

Changes in RUnit 0.4.7
    o   update for checkEqualsNumeric to be compatible with R 2.3.0

Changes in RUnit 0.4.5
    o   improvements to error detection in runTestSuite

Changes in RUnit 0.4.4
    o   changed maintainer

Changes in RUnit 0.4.2
    o   checkTrue: corrected handling of named logical arguments

Changes in RUnit 0.4.1
    o   printHTMLProtocol has new parameter 'testFileToLinkMap'
        to allow to provide a function to add dynamically generated
        URLs for each test case file, e.g. for use with CVSweb

Changes in RUnit 0.4.0

    o   New 'error' category DEACTIVATED introduced: If the function
        DEACTIVATED is inserted into a test function the function
        stops at that point and is reported as deactivated in the test
        protocol.

    o   New function 'getErrors' which takes a list of type
        'RUnitTestData' and returns some very basic error information
        of a test run.

    o   The name of the currently executed test function is written to
        standard out.

    o   'printHTMLProtocol' fixed such that it does not produce a
        warning anymore.

    o   Dependency on package 'splines' removed.

    o   Various small fixes of the documentation.
