party Internet sites, or third party programs, and
* claims for breach of contract, breach of warranty, guarantee or condition,
strict liability, negligence, or other tort to the extent permitted by
applicable law.
It also applies even if
* repair, replacement or a refund for the software does not fully compensate
you for any losses, or
* Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the damages.
Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to
you. They also may not apply to you because your country may not allow the
exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.
